# Module-6-Lab-Activity-
These are my Python programs from the Module 6: Lab Activity. Which uses the random module to provide functions for generating random numbers with different distributions and the math module in Python.
Below are the programs for module 6 lab problems (1-6) I separate each problem's code so it's clear which code corresponds to which problem..
